About
The Contact Book application provide the ability to register, login, and user updates, and work with a private collection of contacts.

Backend. There is a ready-made backend for this task. Check out the documentation -> https://connections-api.herokuapp.com/docs/. It supports all necessary operations on the contact collection, as well as registering, logging in and user update with JWT.

Routing. Added routing with the React Router library. The application has several pages:

/register - public route to register a new user with a form

/login - public login route of an existing user with a form

/contacts - a private route for your contact list

Added a navigation component Navigation with links to navigate routes.

Styling is done using the TailwindCSS.
